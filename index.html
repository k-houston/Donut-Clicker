                <p> Fred the Baker is tired of making real donuts and is ready to retire. He needs our help to keep his love of donuts alive. He wants you to create a game that uses button clicks to create virtual donuts for the world to enjoy. But all those early mornings of donut making may have tired out his brain because he has some strange requirements for 'Auto Clickers' and 'Donut Multipliers'.</p>

                <p>Hello, my name is Kyle Houston and I am currently enrolled in the C# cohort at We Can Code It. While being a full-time student I am also working full-time as a customer service/sales advisor at Best Buy. Before getting into software development I was a student at the University of Akron for Bio/Pre-med. When studying Pre-Med at Akron I was working as a videography for the University of Akron to continue my passion for technology. Software is something that brings the best out of me due to it's nature of complex problem solving and advanced concepts to make the world a better place. Hope you enjoy the game and glad you got to know a little bit about me!</p>
